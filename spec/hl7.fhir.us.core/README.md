# US Core Implementation Guide

US Core was developed under the [Data Access Framework (DAF)](http://wiki.siframework.org/Data+Access+Framework+Homepage)\r\ninitiative. DAF was a US initiative sponsored by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) which aimed to create FHIR profiles \r\nfor access to discrete Meaningful Use Stage 2 data (Common MU Data Set) and key research data elements as FHIR resource instances. \r\nThe initial HL7 DAF Implementation guide was published with the FHIR DSTU2 specification in October of 2015. The \r\n[Argonaut Project](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) formed in December 2014 to accelerate the market readiness \r\nof open industry FHIR-based APIs for patient- and provider-driven interoperability use cases. Several Argonaut sprints were held based \r\nupon the DAF DSTU2 profiles. In 2015, ONC introduced a new rule which updated the required set of data elements to the \r\n[Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS)](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2015Ed_CCG_CCDS.pdf).\r\n\r\nBased upon these activities and HL7 sponsored connectathons it was recognized that the original DAF requirements were overly broad. \r\nTherefore, for FHIR STU3 (Version 3.0.0), the original DSTU2 DAF content was split into the US Core and [DAF Research](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/daf-research/) \r\nImplementation guides based on their main use cases:\r\n\r\n*  **US Core** : The US Core Implementation Guide covers the 2015 Meaningful Use Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) and defines the minimum mandatory conformance requirements needed for accessing patient data based on the Argonaut pilot implementations. The US Core artifacts are consistent with the [Argonaut DSTU2-based Data Query IG](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/) and [Arganaut STU3 based Provider Directory IG](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/). This implementation guide forms the foundation to build future US Realm FHIR implementation guides and its content will continue to grow to meet the needs of US implementers.\r\n\r\n* **DAF-Research** : The DAF-Research Implementation Guide enables researchers to access data from multiple organizations in the context of Learning Health System (LHS). The capabilities created as part of DAF-Research are intended to be leveraged to build our nationâ€™s data infrastructure for a Learning Health System. The DAF-Research IG leverages the work that has been completed and tested as part of the US-Core IG.\r\n\r\nThis table provides a list of all the versions of FHIR versions of the US-Core Implementation Guide that are available. See \r\n[FHIR Releases and Versioning](http://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#versions) for a description of how the versioning of this\r\nImplementation Guide is managed. As well, this guide follow the general definitions and guidelines outlined in [Rules for Inter-version change](http://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#change):
