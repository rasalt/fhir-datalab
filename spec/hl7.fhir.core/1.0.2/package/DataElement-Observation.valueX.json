A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. This element has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueString, valueRange, valueRatio, valueSampledData, valueAttachment, valueTime, valueDateTime, or valuePeriod. (The name format is \"'value' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).   If the data element is usually coded or if the type associated with the Observation.value defines a coded value, use CodeableConcept instead of string datatype even if the value is uncoded text.  A value set is bound to the ValueCodeableConcept element.  For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from [HL7 Version 2 Table 0136](v2/0136/index.html). These \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed.
