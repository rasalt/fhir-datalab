Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.","comments":"Some parties may be duplicated between the target resource and its provenance.  For instance, the prescriber is usually (but not always) the author of the prescription resource. This resource is defined with close consideration for W3C Provenance.","alias":["History","Event","Activity"],"min":0,"max":"*","type":[{"code":"DomainResource"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"w3c.prov","map":"Activity"},{"identity":"rim","map":"ControlAct[isNormalAct() and subsumes(CACT, classCode) and moodCode=EVN]"},{"identity":"w5","map":"infrastructure.information"}]}]}
