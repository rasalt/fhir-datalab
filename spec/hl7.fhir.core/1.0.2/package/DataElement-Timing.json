Timing schedules are used to record when things are expected or requested to occur. The most common usage is in dosage instructions for medications. They are also used when planning care of various kinds.","comments":"A timing schedule can be either a list of events - intervals on which the event occurs, or a single event with repeating criteria or just repeating criteria with no actual event.
