Note that for both humans and particularly animals, there are other legitimate possibilities than M and F, though the vast majority of systems and contexts only support M and F.  Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosonal, social, etc.)  However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice.  Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosonal and other gender aspects.  For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overrideable error, not a \"hard\" error.","requirements":"Needed for identification of the individual, in combination with (at least) name and birth date.
