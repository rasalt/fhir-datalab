If \"params\" element is specified, then \"targetId\" element is ignored. For FHIR operations that require a resource (e.g. \"read\" and \"vread\" operations), the \"resource\" element must be specified when \"params\" element is specified.  If \"url\" and \"params\" elements are absent, then the request url will be constructed from \"targetId\" fixture if present. For \"read\" operation, the resource and id values will be extracted from \"targetId\" fixture and used to construct the url. For \"vread\" and \"history\" operations, the versionId value will also be used.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"code"}],"binding":{"strength":"required","description":"Either a resource or a data type.","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/defined-types"}}}]}
