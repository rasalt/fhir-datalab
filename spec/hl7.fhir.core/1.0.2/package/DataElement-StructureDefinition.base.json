If there is no base, then the differential constraints cannot be provided (snapshot only). Differential structures are useful for the editing perspective, and snapshot structures are suitable for operational use. The FHIR Project provides a number of tools/services to populate snapshots from differential constraints. Logical Models have a base of \"Element\" or another logical model.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"uri"}],"condition":["sdf-4","sdf-10"],"isSummary":true}]}
