Otherwise, the value set may have different expansions as underlying code systems and/or value sets evolve.  The interpretation of lockedDate is often dependent on the context - e.g. a SNOMED CT derived value set with a lockedDate will have a different expansion in USA than in UK.  If a value set specifies a version for include and exclude statements, and also specifies a locked date, the specified versions need to be available that date, or the value set will not be usable.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"date"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"w5","map":"when.init"}]}]}
