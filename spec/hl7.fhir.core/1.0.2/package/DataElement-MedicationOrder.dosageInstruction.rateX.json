Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Currently we do not specify a default of '1' in the denominator, but this is being discussed. Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.","comments":"It is possible to supply both a rate and a doseQuantity to provide full details about how the medication is to be administered and supplied. If the rate is intended to change over time, depending on local rules/regulations, each change should be captured as a new version of the MedicationOrder with an updated rate, or captured with a new MedicationOrder with the new rate.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Ratio"},{"code":"Range"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"RXE-22-Give Per (Time Unit)"},{"identity":"rim","map":"rateQuantity"}]}]}
