So they are deformalised into this location for tooling convenience, and to ensure that the base information is available without dependencies.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Element"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A (MIF territory)"},{"identity":"iso11179","map":"n/a"}]}]}
