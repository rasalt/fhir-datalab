This is called \"abatement\" because of the many overloaded connotations associated with \"remission\" or \"resolution\" - Conditions are never really resolved, but they can abate.","comments":"There is no explicit distinction between resolution and remission because in many cases the distinction is not clear. Age is generally used when the patient reports an age at which the Condition abated.  If there is no abatement element, it is unknown whether the condition has resolved or entered remission; applications and users should generally assume that the condition is still valid.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"dateTime"},{"code":"Quantity","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Age"]},{"code":"boolean"},{"code":"Period"},{"code":"Range"},{"code":"string"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".effectiveTime.high or .inboundRelationship[typeCode=SUBJ].source[classCode=OBS, moodCode=EVN, code=\"age at remission\"].value or .inboundRelationship[typeCode=SUBJ]source[classCode=CONC, moodCode=EVN].status=completed"},{"identity":"w5","map":"when.done"}]}]}
