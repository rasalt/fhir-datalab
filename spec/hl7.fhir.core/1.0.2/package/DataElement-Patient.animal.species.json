Species SHALL be a widely recognised taxonomic classification.  It may or may not be Linnaean taxonomy and may or may not be at the level of species. If the level is finer than species--such as a breed code--the code system used SHALL allow inference of the species.  (The common example is that the word \"Hereford\" does not allow inference of the species Bos taurus, because there is a Hereford pig breed, but the SNOMED CT code for \"Hereford Cattle Breed\" does.).","requirements":"Need to know what kind of animal.","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"isSummary":true,"binding":{"strength":"example","description":"The species of an animal.","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/animal-species"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"cda","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"v2","map":"PID-35"},{"identity":"rim","map":"code"}]}]}
