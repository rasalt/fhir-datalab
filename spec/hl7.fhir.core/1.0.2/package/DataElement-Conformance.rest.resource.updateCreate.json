Allowing this operation means that the server allows the client to create new identities on the server.","comments":"Allowing the clients to create new identities on the server means that the system administrator needs to have confidence that the clients do not create clashing identities between them. Obviously, if there is only one client, this won't happen. While creating identities on the client means that the clients need to be managed, it's much more convenient for many scenarios if such management can be put in place.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}]}]}
