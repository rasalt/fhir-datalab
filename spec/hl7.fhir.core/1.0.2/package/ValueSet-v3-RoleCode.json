Third party administrators are prominent players in the managed care industry and have the expertise and capability to administer all or a portion of the claims process. They are normally contracted by a health insurer or self-insuring companies to administer services, including claims administration, premium collection, enrollment and other administrative activities.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        Self-insured employers often contract with third party administrator to handle their insurance functions. Insurance companies oftentimes outsource the claims, utilization review or membership functions to a TPA. Sometimes TPAs only manage provider networks, only claims or only utilization review.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        While some third-party administrators may operate as units of insurance companies, they are often independent. However, hospitals or provider organizations desiring to set up their own health plans will often outsource certain responsibilities to TPAs.  TPAs may perform one or several payor functions, specified by the PayorParticipationFunction value set, such as provider management, enrollment, utilization management, and fee for service claims adjudication management.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    UMO\n                  <a name=\"UMO\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Utilization management organization</td>\n                <td>\n                        \n                           Description:A payor that is responsible for review and case management of health services covered under a policy or program.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>2</td>\n                <td>  RESPRSN\n                  <a name=\"RESPRSN\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>responsible party</td>\n                <td>\n                        The role played by a party who has legal responsibility for another party.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    EXCEST\n                  <a name=\"EXCEST\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>executor of estate</td>\n                <td>\n                        The role played by a person acting as the estate executor for a deceased subscriber or policyholder who was the responsible party \n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    GUADLTM\n                  <a name=\"GUADLTM\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>guardian ad lidem</td>\n                <td>\n                        The role played by a person appointed by the court to look out for the best interests of a minor child during the course of legal proceedings.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    GUARD\n                  <a name=\"GUARD\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>guardian</td>\n                <td>\n                        The role played by a person or institution legally empowered with responsibility for the care of a ward.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    POWATT\n                  <a name=\"POWATT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>power of attorney</td>\n                <td>\n                        A relationship between two people in which one person authorizes another to act for him in a manner which is a legally binding upon the person giving such authority as if he or she personally were to do the acts.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>4</td>\n                <td>      DPOWATT\n                  <a name=\"DPOWATT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>durable power of attorney</td>\n                <td>\n                        A relationship between two people in which one person authorizes another, usually a family member or relative, to act for him or her in a manner which is a legally binding upon the person giving such authority as if he or she personally were to do the acts that is often limited in the kinds of powers that can be assigned.

These role.codes may only be used with COVPTY to avoid overlapping concepts that would result from using them to specify the specializations of COVPTY, e.g. the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code family dependent because that relationship has overlapping concepts due to the role.code precoodination and is conveyed in FICO with the personal relationship role that has a PART role link to the covered party role.  For the same reasons, the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code HANDIC (handicapped dependent); the role.code DIFFABLE (differently abled) should be used instead.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        In summary, the coded concepts in the Abstract Value Set &quot;CoveredPartyRoleType&quot; can be &quot;post-coordinated&quot; with the &quot;RoleClassCoveredParty&quot; Abstract Value Set.  Decoupling these concepts is intended to support an expansive range of covered party concepts and their semantic comparability.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>2</td>\n                <td>  \n                  <span style=\"color: grey\">\n                    <i>(_CoverageRoleType)</i>\n                  </span>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                  <a name=\"_CoverageRoleType\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                        Role recognized through the issuance of insurance coverage to an identified covered party who has this relationship with the policy holder such as the policy holder themselves (self), spouse, child, etc.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    FAMDEP\n                  <a name=\"FAMDEP\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>family dependent</td>\n                <td>\n                        The player of the role is dependent of the scoping entity.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    HANDIC\n                  <a name=\"HANDIC\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>handicapped dependent</td>\n                <td>\n                        Covered party is a dependent of the policy holder with a physical or mental disability causing a disadvantage that makes independent achievement unusually difficult.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    INJ\n                  <a name=\"INJ\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>injured plaintiff</td>\n                <td>\n                        Covered party is an injured party with a legal claim for compensation against a policy holder under an insurance policy.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>    SELF\n                  <a name=\"SELF\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>self</td>\n                <td>\n                        Covered party is the policy holder.
