For this reason, tue mustSupport flag is never set to true by the FHIR specification itself - it is only set to true in profiles.   This is done in [Resource Profiles](profiling.html#mustsupport), where the profile labels an element as mustSupport=true. When a profile does this, it SHALL also make clear exactly what kind of \"support\" is required, as this can mean many things.  Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a \"key\" element (e.g. one of the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.","requirements":"Allows a profile to set expectations for system capabilities beyond merely respecting cardinality constraints.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"defaultValueBoolean":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"iso11179","map":"??"}]}]}
