The description should capture its intended use, which is needed for ensuring integrity for its use in models across future changes. A description should be provided unless the value set is a contained resource (e.g. an anonymous value set in a profile). Most registries will require a description.","requirements":"Human understandability.","alias":["Scope","Purpose"],"min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"string"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A"}]}]}
