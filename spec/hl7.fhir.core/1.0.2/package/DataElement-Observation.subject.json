The only circumstance in which the subject can be missing is when the observation is made by a device that does not know the patient. In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated.  If the target of the observation is different than the subject, the general extension [observation-focal-subject](extension-observation-focal-subject.html).  may be used.  However, the distinction between the patient's own value for an observation versus that of the fetus, or the donor or blood product unit, etc., are often specified in the observation code.","requirements":"Observations have no value if you don't know who or what they're about.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Group"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Device"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Location"]}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"PID-3"},{"identity":"rim","map":"participation[typeCode=SBJ]"},{"identity":"w5","map":"who.focus"}]}]}
