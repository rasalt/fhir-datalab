Abstract datatypes and extensions cannot be used in an instance. Flagging a constraint structure as abstract conveys design intent but makes no difference to how the structure definition is handled. Note that inline declared elements that are given the type \"Element\" in the profile, but have children described, are anonymous concrete types that specialise Element. Abstract is not relevant for logical models.","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"isSummary":true}]}
