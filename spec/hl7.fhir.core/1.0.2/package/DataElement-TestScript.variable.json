If variable evaluates to nodelist or anything other than a primitive value, then test engine would report error.  Variables would be used to perform clean replacements in \"operation.params\", \"operation.requestHeader.value\", and \"operation.url\" element values during operation calls and in \"assert.value\" during assertion evaluations. This limits the places that test engines would need to look for placeholders \"${}\".  Variables are scoped to the whole script. They are NOT evaluated at declaration. They are evaluated by test engine when used for substitutions in \"operation.params\", \"operation.requestHeader.value\", and \"operation.url\" element values during operation calls and in \"assert.value\" during assertion evaluations.
