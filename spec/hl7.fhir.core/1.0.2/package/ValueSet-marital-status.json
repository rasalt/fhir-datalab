If the only thing that is unknown is how to properly express the value in the necessary constraints (value set, datatype, etc.), then the OTH or UNC flavor should be used.  No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless:\n                      <br/>\n                        \n                           Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of &quot;unknown&quot;.  (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown')\n                           Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown.  (E.g. specifying a use code of &quot;H&quot; and a URL prefix of &quot;tel:&quot; to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)\n                    </td>\n                  </tr>\n                </table>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>"},"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-oid","valueUri":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.2.19"}],"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/marital-status","version":"1.0.2","name":"Marital Status Codes","status":"draft","experimental":true,"publisher":"FHIR Project team","contact":[{"telecom":[{"system":"other","value":"http://hl7.org/fhir"}]}],"date":"2015-10-24T07:41:03+11:00","description":"This value set defines the set of codes that can be used to indicate the marital status of a person.","codeSystem":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-oid","valueUri":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.1.19"}],"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/marital-status","caseSensitive":true,"concept":[{"code":"U","_code":{"fhir_comments":["    work around for missing code in v3 code system - should be temporary, until added in v3    "]},"display":"Unmarried","definition":"The person is not presently married.
