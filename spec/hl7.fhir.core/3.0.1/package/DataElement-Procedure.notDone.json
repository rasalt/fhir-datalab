Typically it would be accompanied by attributes describing the type of activity.  It might also be accompanied by body site information or time information (i.e. no procedure was done to the left arm or no procedure was done in this 2-year period).  Specifying additional information such as performer, outcome, etc. is generally inappropriate.  For example, it's not that useful to say \"There was no appendectomy done at 12:03pm June 6th by Dr. Smith with a successful outcome\" as it implies that there *could* have been an appendectomy done at any other time, by any other clinician or with any other outcome.\n\nThis element is labeled as a modifier because it indicates that a procedure didn't happen.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"defaultValueBoolean":false,"isModifier":true,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".actionNegationInd"}]}]}
