Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Ratio"},{"code":"Range"},{"code":"Quantity","profile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/SimpleQuantity"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".rateQuantity"}]}]}
