The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role such as SubjectofCare, Practitioner, and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and so Person is kept lean. Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the Person himself. Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Practitioner), and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare).","min":0,"max":"*","constraint":[{"key":"dom-2","severity":"error","human":"If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources","expression":"contained.contained.empty()","xpath":"not(parent::f:contained and f:contained)","source":"DomainResource"},{"key":"dom-1","severity":"error","human":"If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain any narrative","expression":"contained.text.empty()","xpath":"not(parent::f:contained and f:text)","source":"DomainResource"},{"key":"dom-4","severity":"error","human":"If a resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT have a meta.versionId or a meta.lastUpdated","expression":"contained.meta.versionId.empty() and contained.meta.lastUpdated.empty()","xpath":"not(exists(f:contained/*/f:meta/f:versionId)) and not(exists(f:contained/*/f:meta/f:lastUpdated))","source":"DomainResource"},{"key":"dom-3","severity":"error","human":"If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL be referred to from elsewhere in the resource","expression":"contained.where(('#'+id in %resource.descendants().reference).not()).empty()","xpath":"not(exists(for $id in f:contained/*/@id return $id[not(ancestor::f:contained/parent::*/descendant::f:reference/@value=concat('#', $id))]))","source":"DomainResource"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"Entity.
