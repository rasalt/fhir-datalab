Resources that are not contained SHOULD have a narrative. In some cases, a resource may only have text with little or no additional discrete data (as long as all minOccurs=1 elements are satisfied).  This may be necessary for data from legacy systems where information is captured as a \"text blob\" or where text is additionally entered raw or narrated and encoded in formation is added later.","alias":["narrative","html","xhtml","display"],"min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Narrative"}],"condition":["dom-1"],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"Act.text?"}]}]}
