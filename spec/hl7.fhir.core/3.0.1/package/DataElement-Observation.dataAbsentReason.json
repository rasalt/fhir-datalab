One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"specimen unsatisfactory\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.","requirements":"For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"condition":["obs-6"],"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"ObservationValueAbsentReason"}],"strength":"extensible","description":"Codes specifying why the result (Observation.value[x]) is missing.","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-valueabsentreason"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Event.notDone, Event.notDoneReason  (maps to valeu[x] or dataAbsentReason)"},{"identity":"v2","map":"N/A"},{"identity":"rim","map":"value.nullFlavor"}]}]}
