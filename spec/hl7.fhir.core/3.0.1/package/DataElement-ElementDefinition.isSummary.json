This element is used to reduce the quantity of data returned in searches. Note that servers may pre-cache summarized resources for optimal performance, so servers may not support per-profile use of the isSummary flag. When a request is made with _summary=true, serailisers only include elements marked as 'isSummary = true'. Other than Attachment.data, all data type properties are included in the summary form. Modifier elements or elements with minimum cardinality = 1 must be marked as summary elements.","requirements":"Allow clients to search through large resources quickly.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"defaultValueBoolean":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A (MIF territory)"},{"identity":"iso11179","map":"??"}]}]}
