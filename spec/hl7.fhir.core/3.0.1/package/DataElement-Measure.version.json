This is an arbitrary value managed by the measure author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.","comment":"There may be different measure instances that have the same identifier but different versions.  The version can be appended to the url in a reference to allow a refrence to a particular business version of the measure with the format [url]|[version].","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"string"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Definition.version"},{"identity":"w5","map":"id.version"}]}]}
