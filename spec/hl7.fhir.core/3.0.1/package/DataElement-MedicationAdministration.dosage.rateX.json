Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.  Other examples:  200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.","comment":"If the rate changes over time, and you want to capture this in MedicationAdministration, then each change should be captured as a distinct MedicationAdministration, with a specific MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate, and the date time when the rate change occurred. Typically, the MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate element is not used to convey an average rate.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Ratio"},{"code":"Quantity","profile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/SimpleQuantity"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"RXA-12-Administered Per (Time Unit)"},{"identity":"rim","map":".rateQuantity"}]}]}
