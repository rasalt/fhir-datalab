The more attributes are populated, the more constrained the negated statement is.  This notDone element is being evaluated and will likely be removed in a subsequent release.","requirements":"Creating a FamilyMemberHistory where notDone is true is intended for situations where there's a need for a specific statement in the record about something not being done.  If the need is merely to indicate that a request wasn't fulfilled, that should be handled using Task.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"defaultValueBoolean":false,"isModifier":true,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".actionNegationInd"}]}]}
