Observations are not made on specimens themselves; they are made on a subject, but in many cases by the means of a specimen.

Also note that observation resources may be used in contexts that track the specimen explicitly (e.g. Diagnostic Report).","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Specimen"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"sct-concept","map":"< 123038009 |Specimen|"},{"identity":"v2","map":"SPM segment"},{"identity":"rim","map":"participation[typeCode=SPC].specimen"},{"identity":"sct-attr","map":"704319004 |Inherent in|"}]}]}
