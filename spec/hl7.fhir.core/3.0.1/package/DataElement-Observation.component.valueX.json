A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value.   For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from <http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136> (these \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed\").  The element, Observation.value[x], has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueRatio, valueChoice, valuePeriod, valueSampleData, or valueString (the name format is \"'value' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).","requirements":"An observation exists to have a value, though it may not if it is in error, or if it represents a group of observations.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Quantity"},{"code":"CodeableConcept"},{"code":"string"},{"code":"Range"},{"code":"Ratio"},{"code":"SampledData"},{"code":"Attachment"},{"code":"time"},{"code":"dateTime"},{"code":"Period"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"sct-concept","map":"363714003 |Interprets| < 441742003 |Evaluation finding|"},{"identity":"v2","map":"OBX.2, OBX.5, OBX.6"},{"identity":"rim","map":"value"},{"identity":"sct-attr","map":"363714003 |Interprets|"}]}]}
