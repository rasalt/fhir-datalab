In general, only the code and timeframe will be present, though occasional additional qualifiers such as body site or even performer could be included to narrow the scope of the prohibition.  If the ProcedureRequest.code and ProcedureRequest.doNotPerform both contain negation, that will reinforce prohibition and should not have a double negative interpretation.","requirements":"Used for do not ambulate, do not elevate head of bed, do not flush NG tube, do not take blood pressure on a certain arm, etc.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"defaultValueBoolean":false,"isModifier":true,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".actionNegationInd"}]}]}
