The Schedule data type allows many different expressions. For example: \"Every 8 hours\"; \"Three times a day\"; \"1/2 an hour before breakfast for 10 days from 23-Dec 2011:\"; \"15 Oct 2013, 17 Oct 2013 and 1 Nov 2013\".  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Timing"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".effectiveTime"}]}]}
