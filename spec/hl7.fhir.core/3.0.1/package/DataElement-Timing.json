Timing schedules are used to record when things are planned, expected or requested to occur. The most common usage is in dosage instructions for medications. They are also used when planning care of various kinds, and may be used for reporting the schedule to which past regular activities were carried out.","comment":"A timing schedule can be either a list of events - intervals on which the event occurs, or a single event with repeating criteria or just repeating criteria with no actual event.  When both event and a repeating specification are provided, the list of events should be understood as an interpretation of the information in the repeat structure.","min":0,"max":"*","condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"Element"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"v2","map":"N/A"},{"identity":"rim","map":"QSET<TS> (GTS)"}]}]}
