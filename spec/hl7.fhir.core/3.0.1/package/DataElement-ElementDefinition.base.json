This information is provided when the element definition is not the original definition of an element - i.g. either in a constraint on another type, or for elements from a super type in a snap shot.","comment":"The base information does not carry any information that could not be determined from the path and related profiles, but making this determination requires both that the related profiles are available, and that the algorithm to determine them be available. So they are deformalised into this location for tooling convenience, and to ensure that the base information is available without dependencies.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Element"}],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"Element"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A (MIF territory)"},{"identity":"iso11179","map":"n/a"}]}]}
