Note that the implication is that if this is set to 'true', there may be only one ValueSet version for this definition. Immutability tends to be set to 'true' in one of two cases: - Where the value set, by the nature of its usage, cannot change.  For example \"All specializations of ACT in ActClassCode\" - Where there's no safe way to express the \"Purpose\" such that someone else could safely make changes to the value set definition. Source workflow control must guarantee that the same URI always yields the same definition.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"isSummary":true}]}
