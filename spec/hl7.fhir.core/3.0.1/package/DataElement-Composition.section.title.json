The title must be consistent with the narrative of the resource that is the target of the section.content reference. Generally, sections SHOULD have titles, but in some documents, it is unnecessary or inappropriate. Typically, this is where a section has subsections that have their own adequately distinguishing title,  or documents that only have a single section. Most Implementation Guides will make section title to be a required element.","requirements":"Section headings are often standardized for different types of documents.
