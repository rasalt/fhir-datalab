# Script intended to be used on gen_fhir_definitions_and_protos rules.
# The only argument to this should be a gen_fhir_definitions_and_protos.
#
# e.g., for rule in //foo/bar/BUILD,
# gen_fhir_definitions_and_protos(
#   name = "quux",
#   ...
# ),
#
# The protos can be generated by running this from the root directory:
# medical/records/fhir/generate_protos.sh foo/bar:quux
#
# This will generate 4 files in the foo/bar/ source directory:
# * foo/bar/quux_extensions.json  (bundle of extension StructureDefinitions)
# * foo/bar/quux_extensions.proto (extensions proto file)
# * foo/bar/quux_profiles.json    (bundle of profile StructureDefinitions)
# * foo/bar/quux_profiles.proto   (profiles proto file)
