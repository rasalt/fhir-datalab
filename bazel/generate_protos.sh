# Script intended to be used on gen_fhir_protos rules.
# The only argument to this should be a gen_fhir_protos.
#
# e.g., for rule in //foo/bar/BUILD,
# gen_fhir_protos(
#   name = "quux",
#   ...
# ),
#
# The protos can be generated by running this from the root directory:
# bazel/generate_protos.sh foo/bar:quux
#
# This will generate foo/bar/quux.proto in the source directory
